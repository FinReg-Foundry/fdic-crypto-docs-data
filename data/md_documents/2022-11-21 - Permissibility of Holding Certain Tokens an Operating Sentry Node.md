Date: 2022-11-21
Summary: This letter from the FDIC to a bank acknowledges receipt of the bank's June 20, 2022 response to the FDIC's April 25, 2022 information request, but notes that acknowledgment does not constitute non-objection. The FDIC identifies that the bank holds tokens used for transactions on a blockchain and may operate a Sentry Node to facilitate certain activities. The FDIC determines that the bank should file an application under Part 362 of FDIC Rules and Regulations requesting consent to hold these tokens on its balance sheet and obtain prior consent before acquiring additional tokens. Regarding the Sentry Node operation, the bank must either provide documentation per FDIC FIL-54-2014 or seek prior consent under Part 362. The letter references Section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Part 362 of FDIC Rules and Regulations, and Section 303.121(b) regarding required filing contents. (AI-generated)

Subject: June 20, 2022 Response to XXXXX Questions and  
Node and XXXXX Activity Permissibility  

Dear Members of the Board:  

On June 20, 2022, the FDIC received the bank’s response to our April 25, 2022 request  
for information (Correspondence). Please note, although we acknowledge receipt of the bank’s  
Correspondence, such acknowledgement does not constitute non-objection. We expect that the  
bank will satisfactorily address our questions to ensure the bank will be engaging in the  
contemplated activities in a safe and sound manner.¹ We are reviewing the Correspondence and  
may request additional information during this review.  

During our review of the Correspondence, it has come to our attention that the bank  
currently holds approximately XXXXX a token that will be used for transactions,  
staking, and grants on the XXXXX Blockchain. The XXXXX Blockchain is the platform  
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX plans to use for transfers. The bank’s XXXXX tokens  
were granted on February 1, 2022, in connection with the bank’s XXXXX membership, and  
are recorded XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The Correspondence also indicates that  
because the Bank XXXXX.  
The Correspondence states that although there are no definitive plans to do so at the  
present time, the bank may purchase additional XXXXX to hold in reserve through cash purchases.  

The Correspondence indicates the bank will not validate transactions on the XXXXX  
Blockchain but may operate a XXXXX Sentry Node (Sentry Node) to facilitate certain  
XXXXX activities. The Sentry Node is managed and supported by XXXXX and is used to  
read and store a copy of the XXXXX ledger for business continuity purposes, for operational  
monitoring and reporting, and for second and third line verification purposes (i.e., to preserve  
and cross-validate applicable on-chain transaction information in the event of any service  
disruption) and as needed or desired for auditing, monitoring, or other reporting purposes.  

In response to the FDIC’s question regarding whether the bank’s membership in the  
XXXXX is permissible under section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and part 362 of  

¹ See, e.g., Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Part 364 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations.

the FDIC Rules and Regulations (Part 362),^2 the Correspondence referred us to section 4.5 of the XXXXX Legal Reference Manual (Legal Manual). This section of the Legal Manual discusses the permissibility of the bank’s ownership of a non-controlling interest in the XXXXX; however, it does not discuss the permissibility of holding XXXXX tokens or operating a Sentry Node. Furthermore, it does not appear that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has specifically addressed the permissibility of either of these activities for a national bank.

As a result, the bank should file an application in accordance with Part 362 requesting the FDIC’s consent to hold the XXXXX on the bank’s balance sheet and obtain the prior consent of the FDIC under Part 362 before acquiring any additional XXXXX. With regard to the proposed activity of operating a Sentry Node, the bank is requested to either provide the FDIC with the documentation contemplated by FDIC FIL-54-2014, Filing and Documentation Procedures for State Banks Engaging, Directly or Indirectly, in Activities or Investments That Are Permissible for National Banks, dated November 19, 2014, for our review (in the event the OCC has specifically addressed the permissibility of this activity for a national bank) or seek and receive the prior consent of the FDIC under Part 362 for this activity. The required contents of a Part 362 filing are outlined under Section 303.121(b) of the FDIC Rules and Regulations.^3 In addition, each submission should include a satisfactory signed legal opinion regarding the permissibility of the proposed activity for the bank.

As noted above, we continue to review and assess the bank’s responses and information provided. As part of that process, we may have additional questions and follow-up correspondence and direction associated with the permissibility of the activities.

Hughes, Regional Director, FDIC, New York Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (https://securemail.fdic.gov/) to the New York Regional Office Mail Room using the following email address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.

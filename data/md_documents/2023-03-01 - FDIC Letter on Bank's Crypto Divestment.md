Subject: Divestiture Plan  

Dear XXXXX  

On January 3, 2023, we received the letter you sent on behalf of XXXXX detailing plans to divest of crypto-assets XXXXX that the Bank currently holds and requesting the FDIC’s approval of the transaction. The transaction detailed in your letter does not require a filing with the FDIC and, therefore, would not require the FDIC’s approval.  

Management should ensure that its valuation and valuation methodology of the crypto-assets are appropriate. The Bank should ensure that its documentation adequately supports the valuation, valuation methodology, assumptions, and determination; the accounting entries and treatment of the transaction; and compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Management’s supporting documentation will be reviewed at future examinations.  

Please provide written confirmation if you decide to move forward with the transaction. The written confirmation should include the date the bank completes its divestment of the crypto-assets.  

Questions regarding this correspondence should be directed to Senior Case Manager XXXXX at XXXXX or XXXXX  

Sincerely,  

Kathy L. Moe  
Regional Director

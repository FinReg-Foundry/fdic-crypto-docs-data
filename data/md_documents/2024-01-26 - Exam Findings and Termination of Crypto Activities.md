title: Exam Findings and Termination of Crypto Activities
Date: 2024-01-26
Summary: This letter from the FDIC Regional Director addresses the resolution of Matters Requiring Board Attention (MRBA) related to a bank's previously notified crypto-related activities. The bank had informed the FDIC of its intent to engage in crypto-related activities through its core service provider in response to Financial Institution Letter 16-2022. The FDIC requested the bank refrain from providing the service pending review and conducted an examination that identified deficiencies in the bank's risk management framework, including inadequate policies for assessing third-party relationships, limited risk assessment, and insufficient vendor due diligence. The MRBA were subsequently closed after the bank notified the FDIC that its service provider was terminating their agreement and the bank confirmed closure of all test accounts. The letter supersedes a previous FDIC communication and requests notification of any future changes in crypto-related activities. (AI-generated)

Subject: Matters Requiring Board Attention  

Dear Members of the Board:  

In a letter dated August 5, 2022, Bank management notified the FDIC and the XXXXX, in response to Financial Institution Letter 16-2022 *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities*, of its intent to XXXXX through XXXXX, the Bank’s core service provider, and XXXXX. On August 26, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of such activities; the letter requested that the Bank refrain from providing the service until we complete that review. FDIC Examiner XXXXX commenced an examination of XXXXX on September 26, 2022. The findings of the examination were transmitted on July 26, 2023. The findings included *Matters Requiring Board Attention* (MRBA) addressing the Bank’s intent to provide crypto-asset related services to its customers.  

The examination noted that the Bank’s risk management framework, including policies for assessing, monitoring, and managing the XXXXX third-party relationship, needed improvement. Due to limited risk assessment and vendor due diligence undertaken by management, the Board of Directors (Board) had not ensured management properly assessed and measured the risks associated with the proposed new service. To communicate these concerns to the Board to ensure risks are appropriately identified, evaluated, and mitigated, the examination included detailed MRBA addressing the following areas: risk assessment, vendor due diligence, Board oversight, and the compliance management system.  

On July 18, 2023, the Bank notified this office that XXXXX was terminating its agreement with the Bank, and that management would soon present the termination letter to the Board. On September 8, 2023, we received your response to the examination findings. Your response confirmed that the Board discussed the XXXXX termination letter at the July 19, 2023 meeting, and decided to “XXXXX.” Your response also stated that all test accounts were closed and notifications were provided to all accountholders.

Based on your response to the examination findings, the MRBA are closed. The FDIC  
acknowledges the Bank’s updated status related to this activity, and the August 26, 2022 FDIC  
letter to the Board is superseded as a result of the July 18, 2023 and September 8, 2023  
communication to the FDIC. The FDIC requests that the Bank notify this office if the status of  
this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future. In addition, management and  
the Board should address the issues noted in the MRBA prior to any decision to enter into similar  
activity in the future.  

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under part 309  
of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). As a reminder, all official

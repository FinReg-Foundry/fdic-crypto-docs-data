Subject: Crypto-Related Activities  

Dear XXXXX,  

We received your April 8, 2022, email in response to FDIC’s April 7, 2022, Financial Institution Letter (FIL) entitled, “Notification and Supervisory Feedback Procedures for FDIC-Supervised Institutions Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities,” (FIL-16-2022).  

Thank you for engaging with the Agency regarding the bank’s activities. To help us better understand the activities based upon your subsequent April 12, 2022, email response, we do have four additional questions which are detailed below.  

- We are assuming that your use of the abbreviation “ISO” refers to Independent Sales Organization. Please provide us with a copy of the contract between the bank and your ISO customer.  
- Please provide details for what services the ISO provides such as Application Programming Interface (API) integration within the bank, recordkeeping, etc.  
- Please provide a brief overview of how the bank’s Bank Secrecy Act and Compliance programs oversee the relationship.  
- Please provide details of any use of an omnibus account for the funds related to the 1 customer (that appears to really represent 4 customers), and if/how FDIC deposit insurance applies to that account or the end users.  

We appreciate your co-operation to better understand your bank’s relationship with crypto-related activities. Please provide a written response to this letter by May 20, 2022. Please address your written communications to Regional Director Kathy L. Moe. You may mail your correspondence to the letterhead address. However, to help facilitate the processing of correspondence, please email documents electronically as a PDF through the FDIC Secure Email

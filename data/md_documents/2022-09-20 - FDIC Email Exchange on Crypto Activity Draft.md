title: FDIC Email Exchange on Crypto Activity Draft
Date: 2022-09-20
Summary: This email thread discusses a bank's notification to the FDIC regarding crypto-related activities in response to FIL-16-2022. FDIC staff review the bank's submission and determine that the reported activities—ACH transactions flowing through deposit accounts and a loan secured by business assets (not by crypto)—fall outside the scope of the FIL. The emails document the internal FDIC review process, with staff preparing a draft letter to inform the bank that their crypto-related activity is outside the scope of the FIL, and the letter being routed through various FDIC personnel for review before sending it to the bank.

Good morning XXXXX

I've attached a draft letter to XXXXX to let them know that the crypto-related activity is outside of our scope. Once you've had a chance to review, I will send it to legal next.

Thanks, XXXXX

Looks good to me. RO DCP and Legal also need to review before we send the draft back to the WO. Please let me know when this review has been performed.

XXXXX - Rae-Ann and Chris concurred this is out of scope. Can you please draft letter back to the back acknowledging receipt and notifying them of the decision? An example is attached if you’d like to use it. Please send it back for review once drafted. Thanks.

We talked with XXXXX and they provided the attached as follow-up. The activity is just ACH transactions flowing through deposit accounts. Nothing significant. I don’t see that we need to explore this further and don’t believe it fits in the FIL.

The loan is secured by business assets. Not material to the bank’s footings. And not secured by crypto. This also should fall outside the FIL.

Thanks,

XXXXX

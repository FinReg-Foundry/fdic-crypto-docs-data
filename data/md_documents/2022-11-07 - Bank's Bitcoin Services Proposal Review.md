title: Bank's Bitcoin Services Proposal Review
Date: 2022-11-07
Summary: This document is a letter from the FDIC's Regional Director to a bank's Board of Directors regarding the bank's notification about its intent to offer crypto-related activities. The bank had informed the FDIC of plans to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin through its digital and mobile banking platform in partnership with a third party, as well as a debit card with bitcoin rewards. The letter also notes the bank had extended credit to a crypto-related entity. Following procedures outlined in FIL-16-2022, the FDIC is requesting detailed information to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of these activities. The letter includes two comprehensive request lists - one focused on crypto-asset collateralized commercial lending (requesting loan agreements, risk assessments, policies, and monitoring procedures) and another focused on the bank's partnerships with third parties for bitcoin services (requesting contracts, policies, transaction flows, fee structures, and customer disclosures).

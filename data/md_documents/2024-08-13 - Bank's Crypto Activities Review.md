title: Bank's Crypto Activities Review
Date: 2024-08-13
Summary: This document contains email correspondence regarding a consultation about a bank's crypto-related activities. The bank had notified the FDIC of its intent to offer crypto-asset products and services through a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) arrangement, and subsequently began offering users the ability to purchase and sell crypto-assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum through its mobile application. The FDIC conducted a review and identified a Level 2 Medium Severity Violation of FDIC Part 328.102(a) for advertisements that failed to include clear disclaimers that crypto-asset products were not FDIC-insured. The consultation was closed with instructions to follow up during the next compliance examination to determine if the bank had corrected the deficiencies noted in the Report of Examination.

XXXXX

I agree that following up during the exam makes the most sense.

Would be able to send this email chain to RADD as a follow-up note to file to assist in recordkeeping for the review?

Thanks!

WO finally closed out the XXXXX crypto consult but it includes the following statement: *If the region has determined that the bank has sufficiently corrected the deficiencies in the DCP ROE related to the crypto-activity review, please notify the appropriate WO points of contact in DCP. If this determination has not yet been made, please contact the WO points of contact in DCP when such an assessment is in progress.*

I suggest we add this as a follow up item to the upcoming exam â€“ if no concerns are noted at the time, we can notify WO that the issues have been addressed. Everyone ok with that?

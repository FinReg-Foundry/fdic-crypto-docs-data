title: Bank Terminates Crypto Services Plan
Date: 2023-01-06
Summary: This letter from the FDIC's Dallas Regional Office acknowledges a bank's notification that it has terminated an agreement with a partner related to offering customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ethereum through the bank's digital and mobile banking platforms. The document outlines the timeline of interactions between the FDIC and the bank, including the bank's initial notification in February 2022 referencing FIL-16-2022, the FDIC's April 2022 request that the bank not proceed with implementation, an August 2022 FDIC request for information to assess safety and soundness implications, and discussions during a December 2022 Safety and Soundness examination. The FDIC confirms that its previous letter has been superseded due to the bank's withdrawal from the crypto project and requests notification if the status of this or other crypto-related activities changes in the future.

Subject: Response to Notification Regarding Crypto-Related Activities

Dear Board of Directors:

On February 22, 2022, we received XXXXX (the Bank) notification of the Bank’s intent to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin and Ethereum through the Bank’s digital and mobile banking platforms in conjunction with XXXXX in response to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022, Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities. On April 15, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting that the Bank not proceed with implementation while the FDIC considered the proposed crypto-related activity. On August 8, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of such activities. During the December 5, 2022, Safety and Soundness examination, additional information was requested and meetings were held with Bank management to discuss the proposed activity.

In a subsequent email sent to the FDIC on December 22, 2022, Bank management stated that effective December 21, 2022, the Bank has terminated the agreement with XXXXX and the contract amendment relating to XXXXX with XXXXX. The email also stated XXXXX and XXXXX have accepted the Bank’s request to withdraw from the project. The FDIC acknowledges the Bank’s updated status related to this activity, and the April 15, 2022, FDIC letter to the Board has been superseded as a result of the Bank’s December 22, 2022, communication to the FDIC. We request that the Bank notify this office if the status of this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future.

Elmquist, Regional Director, FDIC, Dallas Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (https://securemail.fdic.gov/) using the following e-mail address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.

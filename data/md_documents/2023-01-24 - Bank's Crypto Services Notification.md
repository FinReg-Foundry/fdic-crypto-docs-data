As stated in FIL-16-2022, the FDIC may request that institutions provide information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of such activities. In order to begin those assessments, please provide the information in the attached list by February 24, 2023. If the requested information has not yet been developed, include the status and timeline for developing each item in the response, as applicable. Once the FDIC has completed its review of the above-requested information, we will determine whether additional information is necessary to complete the review of the activity. When we have completed our review, the FDIC will provide the institution with relevant supervisory feedback, as appropriate.

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). If you have any questions, please contact Case Manager XXXXX or Review Examiner XXXXX. Written correspondence should be addressed to my attention at the New York Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (securemail.fdic.gov) using the following e-mail address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.

Sincerely,

Frank R. Hughes

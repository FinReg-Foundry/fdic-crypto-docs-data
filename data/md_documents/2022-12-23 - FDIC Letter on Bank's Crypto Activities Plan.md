Board of Directors

XXXXX

December 23, 2022

Subject: Third-Party Crypto-Asset Activity

Dear Members of the Board:

In response to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022, *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities*, on September 12, 2022, Executive Vice President (EVP) XXXXX submitted a notification of the Bank’s intent to work with XXXXX to develop an application programming interface (API) that would allow customers to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets through the Bank’s digital banking platform. Case Manager XXXXX also held a discussion with CEO XXXXX and EVP XXXXX on November 22, 2022, regarding the proposed crypto-related activities. As discussed during the call, the Bank has created test accounts to assist XXXXX in API development, but management does not intend to offer this type of service to customers.

As stated in FIL-16-2022, the FDIC may request that institutions provide information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of crypto-related activities. Accordingly, the FDIC requests the Bank provide the information in the attached list by January 23, 2023. If the requested information has not yet been developed, include the status and timeline for developing each item in the response, as applicable. Once the FDIC has completed its review of the requested information, we will determine whether additional information is necessary to complete the review of the activity. When we have completed our review, the FDIC will provide the institution with relevant supervisory feedback, as appropriate.

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). If you have any questions, please contact Case Manager XXXXX at XXXXX, or Regional Examination Specialist XXXXX at XXXXX. Written correspondence should be addressed to my attention at the Chicago Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (securemail.fdic.gov) using the following email address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.

Sincerely,

Gregory P. Bottone  
Regional Director

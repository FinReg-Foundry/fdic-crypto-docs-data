title: Bank Withdraws Crypto Activity Plans
Date: 2023-08-17
Summary: This letter from the FDIC acknowledges a bank's notification regarding its intent to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets through its digital and mobile banking platform in partnership with another entity. The notification was provided pursuant to FIL-16-2022, which requires FDIC-supervised institutions to notify the FDIC about crypto-related activities. Following the notification, the FDIC requested information to assess safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications, instructing the bank to refrain from providing these services until review completion. The letter notes that during a Joint Examination and in subsequent communication, the bank's Chief Risk Officer indicated they no longer intend to engage in the previously notified crypto activity, which the FDIC acknowledges, superseding their earlier letter. The FDIC requests notification if the status of this or other crypto-related activities changes in the future. (AI-generated)

Subject: Response to Notification of Engagement in Crypto-Related Activities  

Dear Members of the Board:  

The FDIC acknowledges the notification provided by XXXXX (the Bank) dated August 12, 2022, regarding the Bank’s intent to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold XXXXX through the Bank’s digital and mobile banking platform in conjunction with XXXXX. The notification was provided pursuant to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022 Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities. FIL-16-2022 requested that all FDIC supervised institutions that intend to engage in, or that are currently engaged in, any activities involving or related to crypto-assets promptly notify the appropriate FDIC Regional Director. On September 13, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of such activities. This letter also noted that once the FDIC completed its review of the requested information, it would determine whether additional information was necessary to complete review of the activity; the FDIC would provide the institution with relevant supervisory feedback, as appropriate; and until the FDIC completed its review, the Bank should refrain from providing these services to its customers.  

In discussions with the examination team during the February 21, 2023 Joint Examination, and in an email dated May 30, 2023, Chief Risk Officer XXXXX indicated that the Bank no longer intends to engage in the activity outlined in the Bank’s notification. The FDIC acknowledges the Bank’s updated status related to this activity, and the September 13, 2022, FDIC letter to the Board has been superseded because of the communications to the FDIC during the February 21, 2023 examination and on May 30, 2023. We request that the Bank notify this office if the status of this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future.

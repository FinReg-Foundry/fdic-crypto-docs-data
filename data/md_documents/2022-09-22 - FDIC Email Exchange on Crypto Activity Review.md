title: FDIC Email Exchange on Crypto Activity Review
Date: 2022-09-22
Summary: This document contains an email exchange regarding a legal referral for a bank's crypto-related activities. The discussion centers on a template letter being sent to a bank's board notifying them that their reported crypto-related activity falls outside the scope of FDIC guidance. The emails indicate that the bank's activities involve "crypto-related transactions" passing through deposit accounts. There is a clarification request to verify whether the activities involve cash generated from crypto activities being passed through the bank's deposit accounts, which would align with the region's past treatment of similar cases. The letter was reviewed and approved by Washington and Legal with no changes requested. (AI-generated)

XXXXX

I wanted to make sure the specific crypto activities of XXXXX were reviewed by Washington. I know that in the past, we sent these letters when the bank merely held deposit accounts for entities that participated in crypto-related activities. I couldn’t gather from the proposed letter if those were the same activities proposed by XXXXX when the letter states “crypto-related transactions” that pass through the bank’s deposit accounts. Certainly, if it’s cash generated from those activities being passed through, this would line up with my understanding of the region’s past treatment.

Other than verifying the review of the activities, Legal has no changes to the letter.

Good morning. Just an fyi on this letter. It’s a template letter that has previously been vetted so it shouldn’t take long to review. Thanks

Good morning,

I’ve attached a letter to the Board notifying them that the reported crypto-related activity is outside of the scope of our guidance. Please review the letter for any recommendations or concerns.

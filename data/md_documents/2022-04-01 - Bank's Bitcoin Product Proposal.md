title: Bank's Bitcoin Product Proposal
Date: 2022-04-01
Summary: This document summarizes a Teams call between FDIC officials and bank management regarding the bank's proposed crypto-related product. The bank was asked to pause all crypto asset-related activity in prior correspondence. During the meeting, bank management described their planned product that would allow customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin through a third-party service, with Bitcoin held in a custodian account belonging to customers. The bank explained that Bitcoin would never touch the bank's balance sheet, no "wallets" would be offered, and appropriate disclosures would indicate Bitcoin is not FDIC insured. Management discussed their due diligence, including a risk assessment covering various risk categories, with compliance, operational, strategic, and reputational risks identified as high and medium risks. The bank indicated they were pursuing this product to remain competitive with Fintech companies and other banks. (AI-generated)

title: Crypto-Asset Risk Management Findings
Date: 2023-07-26
Summary: This letter from the FDIC to a bank's Board of Directors transmits an examination report that includes findings related to the bank's proposed crypto-asset service. The FDIC identifies several "Matters Requiring Board Attention" concerning the bank's crypto-asset activities, including deficiencies in risk assessment, vendor due diligence, board oversight, and compliance management systems. The FDIC instructs the bank to implement corrective actions to address these matters before offering the new crypto-asset service. The letter notes that the bank had recently received notice that its service provider was terminating their agreement, which would alter the required corrective actions. The FDIC requests a written response from the bank within 45 days describing planned corrective actions. (AI-generated)

Dear Board of Directors:  

Enclosed for your consideration is a copy of the report of examination of XXXXX prepared by Corporation Examiner XXXXX. The examination commenced on September 26, 2022, utilizing financial information as of June 30, 2022. The examination report includes the composite and component ratings assigned under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. The examination report also includes the findings of a concurrent off-site review by the FDIC Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection (DCP) to review the proposed crypto-asset related activity. The contents of this letter and the examination report, including these ratings, are subject to the confidentiality restrictions of Part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations. Refer to the front cover of the report of examination for further details.

The purpose of *Matters Requiring Board Attention* is to focus the Board’s attention on material matters that require timely resolution. *Matters Requiring Board Attention* are discussed on page 1 of the report of examination and require the Board’s attention and corrective action. The severity of these items necessitates regulatory review prior to your next examination, and ongoing monitoring until these matters are resolved. If not resolved, these issues may adversely impact the institution. *Matters Requiring Board Attention* include:

CRYPTO-ASSET SERVICE

Management notified the FDIC and the XXXXX that the bank intends to “XXXXX” the bank’s core service provider, and XXXXX. The risk management framework, including policies, for assessing, monitoring, and managing the XXXXX third party relationship needs improvement. Due to limited risk assessment and vendor due diligence undertaken by management, the Board has not ensured management properly assessed and measured the risks associated with the proposed new service. To ensure risks are appropriately identified, evaluated, and mitigated, the Board should take the following actions.

Risk Assessment - The Board should ensure that management implements a comprehensive framework and controls that provide for effective risk assessment over the XXXXX services. The Board should ensure that the framework is commensurate with the nature of existing and evolving safety and soundness and consumer protection risks specific to crypto-assets. The Board should ensure that management performs a comprehensive risk assessment for the XXXXX services. The risk assessment should appropriately identify potential enterprise-wide risks, as well as the risk of consumer harm, to ensure that such risks are sufficiently mitigated.

Vendor Due Diligence - The Board should ensure that management conducts appropriate due diligence prior to entering into any contracts. Moreover, as policy issues continue to change, and given recent volatility in crypto assets, the Board should ensure that management continues to periodically monitor the third party and any impacts on the bank and its customers.

Board Oversight - The Board should ensure appropriate policies, procedures, and controls are in place for management to effectively identify, assess, manage, and control risks. The framework should include Board oversight that ensures management has fully assessed the risk associated with the new services as they relate to the institution’s overall strategic plan and risk appetite; performed appropriate due diligence to assess third parties and the relationship; performed appropriate contract reviews to understand roles and responsibilities, as well as risks and liabilities to the bank; and developed processes to perform appropriate ongoing monitoring. The Board’s review and approval of the risk assessment, vendor due diligence, and contract should be documented in the Board minutes.

Compliance Management System (CMS) - The Board should ensure that sufficient controls are in place to account for and mitigate the applicable consumer compliance risks associated with facilitating customer crypto asset trading alongside traditional banking products and services. The Board should enhance its CMS to ensure the risks of consumer harm relative to the crypto asset service are appropriately identified and mitigated. Failure to implement an enhanced CMS could result in customer confusion about the nature and risks associated with crypto assets, including potential consumer harm.

The Board should implement corrective action to address *Matters Requiring Board Attention*. Your corrective action or proposed corrective action will be initially assessed through your written response to the examination report as further discussed below. Once the determination is made and communicated that the *Matters Requiring Board Attention* are resolved, the Board may move forward with offering the new crypto-asset service to the extent consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

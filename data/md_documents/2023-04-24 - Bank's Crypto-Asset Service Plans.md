Subject: Third-Party Crypto-Asset Activity  

Dear Members of the Board:  

On June 30, 2022, XXXXX (the Bank) notified the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of the intent to offer crypto-asset services to customers. This notification was in response to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022, *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities*. Acting Case Manager XXXXX held a phone discussion with Head of Digital Assets XXXXX on July 15, 2022, to discuss the Bank’s crypto-asset plans.  

On September 9, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting that the Bank delay expansion of crypto-asset services while the FDIC considered the proposed crypto-related activity. Furthermore, the letter provided a crypto-asset activity request list and requested the information by October 18, 2022. On October 11, 2022, the Bank informed the FDIC that, due to prioritization of other projects, more time was needed to assemble the information. The letter stated that the request list should be completed by the first part of 2023.  

On March 15, 2023, Case Manager XXXXX and Review Examiner XXXXX held a phone discussion with Bank management to discuss the status of crypto-asset initiatives. On March 28, 2023, Chairman and CEO XXXXX submitted a letter updating the FDIC and XXXXX on the status of the Bank’s crypto-asset activities in response to FIL-16-2022. CEO XXXXX stated that, due to other projects, including the consummation of a merger, the Bank does not expect to launch crypto-related activities before the fourth quarter of 2023; however, no clear proposed timeline for the activity has been provided. To date, the FDIC also has not received any of the items requested in its letter to the Bank dated September 9, 2022.  

Please keep the FDIC and XXXXX updated as to the timeline for the Bank’s crypto-asset plans and when the previously requested items will be received. The FDIC’s September 9, 2022 letter included a request list and requested that the Bank not proceed with planned activities until the FDIC had completed its review and provided supervisory feedback.

Hi all,

Thanks for the edits. See the attached updated version for review by Chris and Rae-Ann. We accepted all the edits you provided and added one new sentence to replace the one you deleted – I ran this language by Sumaya already. Our DRDs have reviewed and signed off on this version.

Once Rae-Ann and Chris sign off, we’ll have Frank send it.

Thanks,  
Ashley

Hi Ashley,

Thank you for drafting and for using XXXXX as the template. We made some edits for consistency with other letters as well. As you’ll see in my comments to the second paragraph, XXXXX was a bit unique because they received a letter asking them to expand. In this case, XXXXX did not. Let me know if you have any questions/concerns and would like to discuss any edits.

Thanks.

Subject: XXXXX Letter to Bank - Digital Asset Activity - Project on Hold

Hi Sumaya and XXXXX

XXXXX notified us that they have put their crypto plans on hold until further notice. In light of this change, they asked that they no longer have to respond to our information request. We have drafted the attached letter to confirm that. We modeled this letter based on the language from a similar letter to XXXXX.

Please review and let us know if you are okay with the region sending this to the bank.

Thanks,
Ashley

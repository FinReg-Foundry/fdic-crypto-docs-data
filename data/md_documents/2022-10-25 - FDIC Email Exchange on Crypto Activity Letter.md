Hi Mary,

Thank you for updating. This version looks good (if you could change 12/31 to 12/30, so that it’s on a Friday).

Thanks  
Sumaya

Sumaya,

I updated the letter as we discussed last week. This will allow us to receive some of the requested information, if they have it, by year end.

Let me know if this is ready to send out.

Thanks,  
Mary

Hi Mary,

The typical timeframe provided to banks has been 60 days. For consistency, I would suggest replacing the ‘if the bank...’ to a 60 day date. The sentence that follows provides the bank with flexibility to let us know which of the items they don’t have yet and when they expect they will be developed (which will give us a sense of when to follow-up for those items). Let me know if you’d like to discuss.

One other item I just noticed, we probably should delete “above” in “above-requested.”

Thanks  
Sumaya

Hi Sumaya,

The edit to paragraph 2 looks good. For your note in paragraph 3, I’m not sure how we what date we would put there or a timeframe (ie. Within 30, 60 days…) I would rather just keep it the way it is and I’m sure we will be following up with the bank.

If that is ok, we would like to send it out.

Thanks,  
Mary

title: Bank Halts Crypto Activities
Date: 2023-01-17
Summary: This letter from the FDIC Regional Director acknowledges that a bank had previously engaged in crypto-related activities with a company that offered digital assets using blockchain technology, where the company maintained a deposit account at the bank to hold U.S. dollars exchanged for digital assets. During an FDIC examination, the FDIC requested information to assess the safety and soundness implications of this activity. The bank subsequently informed the FDIC that it was no longer engaging in this digital-based activity, as the company had ceased offering digital assets. The FDIC acknowledges this status change and requests notification if the bank's involvement in this or other crypto-related activities changes in the future, referencing FIL-16-2022 regarding notification requirements for crypto-related activities.

## Subject: Engagement in Crypto-Related Activities

Dear Members of the Board:

In November 2021, XXXXX (Bank) management discussed the Bank’s proposed engagement in activity with XXXXX with FDIC field and regional office staff. XXXXX offered digital XXXXX which was a XXXXX XXXXX using blockchain technology. XXXXX maintained a deposit account at the Bank to hold a portion of the U.S. dollars exchanged for digital XXXXX. During the July 5, 2022, FDIC examination, the FDIC requested information necessary to allow the FDIC to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of the activity. Subsequently, in an email dated November 22, 2022, Executive Vice President Chief Risk Officer XXXXX stated that the Bank is no longer engaging in digital-based activity with XXXXX which ceased offering digital XXXXX in XXXXX. The FDIC acknowledges the Bank’s updated status related to this activity.

We request that the Bank notify this office if the status of this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future. Please refer to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), [FIL-16-2022 Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities](securemail.fdic.gov) which requests that all FDIC supervised institutions that intend to engage in, or that are currently engaged in, any activities involving or related to crypto-assets (also referred to as “digital assets”) promptly notify the appropriate FDIC Regional Director. Written correspondence should be addressed to my attention at the New York Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal ([securemail.fdic.gov](securemail.fdic.gov)) using the following e-mail address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.

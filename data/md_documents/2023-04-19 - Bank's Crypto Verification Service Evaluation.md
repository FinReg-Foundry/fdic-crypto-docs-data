Summary: This document is a letter from the FDIC's Chicago Regional Office acknowledging a bank's notification of its intent to offer a third-party authorization verification service for customer transactions in crypto-assets, as required by FIL-16-2022. The FDIC indicates that while the bank provided a summary of proposed activities, additional documentation is needed to evaluate safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability considerations. The letter includes an extensive attachment requesting detailed information across multiple categories - general information about the proposed activities (including transaction verification, node functions, and multi-signature processes), technical details (transaction flow diagrams, custody solutions, logical controls), operational aspects (implementation timelines, risk assessments, third-party due diligence), and consumer protection information (customer agreements, fee structures, marketing materials). The bank is asked to respond by May 31, 2023. (AI-generated)

Enclosed is a request for additional information needed to fully review the proposed activities and provide appropriate supervisory feedback to the Bank. Please respond to the request no later than May 31, 2023.  

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under Part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). If you have any questions, please contact Case Manager XXXXX at XXXXX, or Review Examiner XXXXX at XXXXX. Written correspondence should be addressed to my attention at the Chicago Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC's Secure Email portal (securemail.fdic.gov) using the following e-mail address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov.  

Sincerely,  
Gregory P. Bottone

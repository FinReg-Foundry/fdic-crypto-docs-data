title: Concerns Over Bank's Crypto Proposal
Date: 2023-01-05
Summary: This letter from the FDIC Regional Director to a bank president addresses the bank's proposed crypto-related product involving a decentralized public blockchain. The FDIC expresses several safety and soundness concerns about the product, including the use of a decentralized public blockchain without customary governance mechanisms; the bank's reliance on third-party nodes without contractual relationships; challenges in risk quantification and monitoring; information security issues related to publishing customer transactions on a public blockchain; and the bank's plan to hold crypto-assets as a node operator. The letter references Appendices A and B to Part 364 and Part 362 of FDIC Rules and Regulations, and concludes that the FDIC is unable to determine that the bank can conduct the proposed product or pilot in a safe and sound manner.

Subject: XXXXX

Dear XXXXX,

On September 14, 2022, the FDIC met with you and other members of management to discuss the bank’s proposed XXXXX product and pilot launch. In our letter to you on March 25, 2022, we stated we had a number of questions based on the discussion and information provided to date. The September 14, 2022 meeting and additional comments received on September 20, 2022 and October 31, 2022, provided some useful additional information. During the meeting and in follow-up correspondence you expressed a desire to begin providing the product to XXXXX.

We recognize the efforts by your institution to develop the XXXXX product. We also recognize that emerging crypto-related activities may present potential opportunities for financial institutions; however, these nascent activities also introduce significant safety and soundness risks for banking organizations and their customers, and may present potential systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. As discussed with you previously, the proposed XXXXX product raises several novel and complex considerations related to safety and soundness risks. Matters presenting significant risks include, but are not limited to: the use of a decentralized public blockchain; the financial institution operating as and relying on third-party nodes; and bank ownership, use, and holding of crypto-assets.

One area of particular concern related to XXXXX is the bank’s ability to quantify, monitor, and control risk related to operating on the public XXXXX. The software runs across a decentralized, open network without customary governance mechanisms; importantly, there are no owners or board of directors/trustees with fiduciary responsibilities related to the network. Also, the bank would not be able to have a contract with XXXXX. Contracts are a critical tool for managing third-party risk as they establish and document specific expectations and obligations of both the financial institution and their technology service providers on a range of issues. For example, without a contract the bank may not be able to fully understand: (1) the responsibilities XXXXX.

XXXXX regarding business continuity and may not have sufficient detail to manage that risk; (2) the responsibilities regarding network security such as software code security and incident notification to the bank, regulators, or law enforcement; and (3) the recourse available to the bank should service be disrupted. It is not clear how the bank’s internal audit system could provide for adequate testing and review of such an information system.¹

The bank’s reliance on third parties for validation of customer entries on a decentralized public blockchain to support its books and records is not only novel, it also raises critical questions regarding the safety and soundness of the proposal, including the adequacy of management information systems, internal controls, and information security.² For example, information security standards state that an institution's information security program shall be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In contrast, a central element of the XXXXX proposal is publication of customer transactions on a public blockchain, with those transactions validated by third-party nodes. Although you have explained the bank would have the ability through the current operating rules of the public XXXXX to vet node operators that would validate its transactions, these node operators would not be operating under a service agreement or contract with the bank. Additionally, the bank has not thoroughly identified controls to mitigate the risk of unintended centralities.

Finally, the proposal contemplates the bank serving as a node on the public XXXXX. Node operators, including the bank, would be required to purchase crypto-assets to operate on the public XXXXX and would receive crypto-assets for their validation services. In response to our questions regarding the safety and soundness of holding such assets on the bank’s books, you have emphasized that the amount would be small, as XXXXX have a minimal value. That may be the case at present, but it may not be in the future. As a class, crypto-assets have demonstrated significant volatility and have no intrinsic value, raising significant safety and soundness concerns as to their appropriateness as a bankable asset. Further, the bank has not addressed the legal permissibility of holding crypto-assets on its books, in any amount, under federal and state law.³ The bank’s legal opinion did not specifically discuss the permissibility regarding the use of a public blockchain; the financial institution operating as and relying on third party nodes; or the bank’s ownership, use, and holding of crypto-assets.

For the reasons outlined above, we are unable to determine that the bank has the ability to conduct the proposed XXXXX product or pilot in a safe and sound manner.

title: Bank Suspends Bitcoin Activities
Date: 2023-01-13
Summary: This letter from the FDIC's New York Regional Office acknowledges a bank's notification about its intent to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto-assets through its digital and mobile banking platforms. The document outlines a sequence of interactions between the FDIC and the bank, including the bank's initial notification pursuant to FIL-16-2022, the FDIC's request for the bank to refrain from expanding the service, subsequent information requests from the FDIC to assess safety and soundness implications, and ultimately the bank's decision to indefinitely suspend its plan to engage in third-party Bitcoin facilitation activity. The FDIC acknowledges this suspension, notes that previous information request letters have been superseded, and requests notification if the status of this or other crypto-related activities changes in the future.

Dear Members of the Board:  

On May 19, 2022, we received XXXXX XXXXX (Bank’s) notification regarding the Bank’s intent to offer customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto-assets XXXXX through the Bank’s digital and mobile banking platforms in conjunction with XXXXX XXXXX in response to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022, Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities. On June 30, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting that the Bank refrain from expanding this service while we considered the proposed crypto-related activity. On September 1, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting information necessary to allow us to assess the safety and soundness, consumer XXXXX protection, and financial stability implications of such activities; CEO and President XXXXX XXXXX provided a response to this letter on October 31, 2022. On December 1, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter asking for confirmation that all relevant information regarding the Bank’s planned Bitcoin facilitation activity had been provided.  

In his December 6, 2022 letter, CEO and President XXXXX XXXXX advised the FDIC that the Bank has indefinitely suspended its plan to engage in this third-party Bitcoin facilitation activity.

We request that the Bank notify this office if the status of this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future.

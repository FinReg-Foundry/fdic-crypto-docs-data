Board of Directors  
XXXXX

Members of the Board:

On April 11, 2022, and April 21, 2022, we received correspondence from President and Chief Executive Officer, XXXXX, addressing XXXXX (bank) potential entrance into digital asset activities. Additionally, President XXXXX and several members of his staff met with representatives from the FDIC and XXXXX on May 4th, 2022, to discuss the products and services that may be offered by the bank. We appreciate the opportunity to review the information provided and to meet with President XXXXX and his staff. We understand that due diligence is ongoing, as is the development of the program’s framework, and that the bank is not currently engaged in digital asset related activity.

The correspondence includes a high level description of potential digital asset activity, and the meeting expanded on this activity. The potential activities include the offering of small dollar loans secured by digital assets to certain known customers with sources of repayment other than digital assets. To provide the means for the customer to transfer these digital assets to your bank, management proposed to establish digital wallets with two third party digital asset platforms. Additionally, management is exploring establishing an arrangement with another third party service provider, which would provide customers the capability to use the bank’s online banking platform to purchase, sell, and hold digital assets through the third party service provider.

So that we may better assess management’s proposed activities, please provide the following information:

- For each product or service planned
  - the structure thereof, including borrower credit criteria, allowable loan purposes, transaction approval structure, any limitations for individual loan amounts or portfolio concentrations, and third party services used for each stage of activity from the bank and consumer perspective;
  - Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) / Office of Foreign Assets Control implications thereof, including how suspicious activity is monitored;
  - how engaging in the various activities relating thereto may impact customer risk scoring, consumer compliance, and consumer disclosure requirements; and
  - IT related impacts thereof such as the maintenance of the confidentiality of personally identifiable information and data integrity.

- Information on the types of wallets selected, how wallets are structured (e.g. custodial wallets or other), how customer digital assets will be identified within wallets, how any customer digital assets will be transferred into wallets (e.g. will the bank receive assets directly from customers or will they be transferred directly into wallets), private key management framework (e.g. how will private keys be handled, who will have access to keys, etc.), and other associated controls.

- All vendor due diligence conducted on third parties associated with digital asset activities, including vendor contracts, the bank’s legal review or assessment of contracts, financial reviews of third parties, and any related documentation.

Additionally, please provide oversight responsibilities of the Board and each applicable committee, including members, frequency of meetings, and approval authority.

Please provide the process of perfecting the bank’s interest in the collateral and the process of a liquidation scenario, including if the bank will own or hold digital assets at any step in the process.

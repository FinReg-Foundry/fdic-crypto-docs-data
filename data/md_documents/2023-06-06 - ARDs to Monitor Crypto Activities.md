title: ARDs to Monitor Crypto Activities
Date: 2023-06-06
Summary: This email instructs Assistant Regional Directors (ARDs) to have case managers check in with banks that have connections with a redacted entity to see if they have observed any unusual activities, such as deposit activity. The email notes that if the bank is supervised by another agency, the case manager should plan to touch base as part of routine communications with the other agency contact. The email also mentions that a redacted individual is traveling to a redacted meeting and will have limited availability to assist with these calls over the next couple of days. (AI-generated)

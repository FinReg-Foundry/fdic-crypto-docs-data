For your reference, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued the _Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations_ (Joint Statement) on January 3, 2023 via Financial Institution Letter (FIL)-01-2023 (https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2023/fil23001.html). It states that banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. Furthermore, this Joint Statement details specific key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be aware of, while also highlighting that the agencies have safety and soundness concerns with business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities or have concentrated exposures to the crypto-asset sector.

The FDIC also issued FIL-16-2022, _Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities_, on April 7, 2022. It requests that all FDIC supervised institutions that intend to engage in, or that are currently engaged in, any activities involving or related to crypto-assets (also referred to as “digital assets”) promptly notify the appropriate FDIC Regional Director. This includes when initial discussions, conversations or evaluations commence regarding a new or existing partner with crypto-related activities.

title: Bank's Crypto Activities Unchanged
Date: 2024-06-21
Summary: This document contains an email exchange between an FDIC Case Manager and a bank representative regarding follow-up inquiries about the bank's crypto-related activities. The FDIC is following up on previously reported crypto-related activities, which included DDA accounts with crypto pass-through transactions (approximately 250 transactions per month, less than 1% of total activity, primarily through a redacted entity) and a single commercial loan to a client where no crypto was taken as collateral. The bank representative confirms that there have been no changes to the bank's crypto-related activities since the last report. The exchange references FIL 16-2022 relating to crypto-related activity. (AI-generated)

XXXXX It appears my reply on 6/10 did not go through. May be an issue because I sent though my phone. No changes since last inquiry. Thanks and let us know if you need anything else. Have a great weekend!

title: FDIC Crypto Notification Discrepancy Discussion
Date: 2022-07-01
Summary: This email discusses a crypto notification from a bank, noting a discrepancy in the tracking system where the activity was marked as not within the FIL scope, while the letter suggests it is in scope. The sender requests that the recipients change the tracking system to indicate the activity is within scope and add it as an associated activity of "Facilitating Customer Buy/Sell" with a third party. The email mentions that a template letter and request list for this type of activity is being developed and will be distributed to regions soon. (AI-generated)

Hi, XXXXX and Rick,

I wanted to touch base on the XXXXX crypto notification. In the tracking system, it reflects that the activity is not within the FIL scope. However, based on the letter, it does appear to be in scope. Please let me know if you’d like to chat and I’ll set up time for next week. Otherwise, if you could change it to “Yes” within scope and add it as an associated activity (Facilitating Customer Buy/Sell, with XXXXX as the third party), that would be great. We are working on a template letter and request list for this particular type of activity and hope to have it out to the regions in the near future.

Have a good fourth,
Sumaya

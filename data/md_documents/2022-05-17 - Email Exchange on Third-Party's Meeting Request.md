I assume you saw that we submitted this disclosure.

The company that we invested in is looking to make a connection with the regulatory agencies and we are wondering what would be the best way to go about doing that? My understanding is that they are interested in starting a conversation on all things crypto/digital asset related and begin a relationship.

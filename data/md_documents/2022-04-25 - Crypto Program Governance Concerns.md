title: Crypto Program Governance Concerns
Date: 2022-04-25
Summary: This letter from the FDIC to a bank's Board of Directors contains extensive questions about the bank's participation in a blockchain-based program referred to as "XXXXX." Following a February 2022 meeting with regulatory agencies, the FDIC is requesting detailed information about the program by June 9, 2022. The attached questionnaire covers eight major areas - governance and structure, classifications, accounting, exposure to other members, risk management and controls, settlement, use cases, and consumer protection. The questions seek information about the blockchain protocol, smart contracts, transaction validation, reserve requirements, risk mitigation strategies, settlement processes, and consumer protections. The FDIC cites FIL-16-2022, which requires institutions to provide information for assessing safety and soundness implications of such activities, and references Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Part 364 of FDIC Rules and Regulations.

- Subject: Questions Related to XXXXX  

Dear Members of the Board:  

On February 22, 2022, the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System met with the XXXXX and its member banks at the time. At that meeting, it was evident that the XXXXX had yet to finalize the use cases or functionality of the product and the Operating Rules by which the XXXXX and its members would be governed. The discussion indicated phases or versions of the product, with future solutions, and, subsequently, the FDIC has received revised information outlining three models under consideration for the XXXXX program.  

In our letter to you on April 22, 2022, the FDIC stated it has a number of questions based on the discussion and information provided to date. The initial questions are attached and we request responses by June 9, 2022. As noted in our prior letter, we expect you to satisfactorily address these and any subsequent questions (in advance of implementation) to ensure the bank is operating in a safe and sound manner.¹ This is consistent with FIL-16-2022, which requests that institutions provide information necessary to allow the agency to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of such activities.  

Written correspondence should be addressed to Jessica A. Kaemigk, Acting Regional Director, FDIC, New York Regional Office, and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (https://securemail.fdic.gov/) using the following email address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov. Information about how to use secure email and FAQs about the service can be found at https://www.fdic.gov/secureemail/.  

If you have any questions, please contact Assistant Regional Director Ashley M. Amicangioli at XXXXX.  

Sincerely,  
Jessica A. Kaemigk  
Acting Regional Director  

¹ See e.g., Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Part 364 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations.

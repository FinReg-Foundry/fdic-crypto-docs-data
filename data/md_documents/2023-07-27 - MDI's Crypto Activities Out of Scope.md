title: MDI's Crypto Activities Out of Scope
Date: 2023-07-27
Summary: This memorandum documents the FDIC's analysis of whether two crypto-related activities reported by a bank fall within the scope of FIL-16-2022. The bank proactively notified the FDIC on September 28, 2022, about relationships with two entities potentially involving crypto-related activities. For the first entity, the bank terminated the relationship on March 6, 2023, due to growing risks, and the FDIC determined this activity to be out of scope of FIL-16-2022. For the second entity, after examination by Compliance EIC, no evidence of digital asset involvement was found, resulting in a determination that this relationship was also outside the scope of FIL-16-2022. The FDIC plans to send an "Out of Scope" letter to the bank's board, reminding them to notify the Regional Director of any intent to engage in digital assets related activities. (AI-generated)

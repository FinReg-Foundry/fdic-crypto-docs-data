title: FDIC Email Exchange on Crypto Activity Monitoring
Date: 2023-04-24
Summary: This document contains email correspondence regarding the FDIC's supervision of a bank's relationship with a crypto firm. The emails discuss the bank's involvement with a crypto customer that serves as a custodian of crypto customers, with FDIC examiners tracking the deposit accounts and potential cryptocurrency activity. The correspondence indicates that while the crypto firm had accounts at the bank, these accounts primarily reflected capital raises rather than active cryptocurrency transactions at the time of examination. The emails show FDIC staff collaborating on examination findings, requesting clarification about the nature of the crypto-related activities, and planning follow-up during future examinations to monitor the relationship. The document includes discussion of deposit account balances and mentions that bank management provided information indicating the accounts are or will be utilized for cryptocurrency activity.

Thank you XXXXX That’s very helpful. It looks like there is a DCP exam in May, which will be a good opportunity for follow-up.

Thank you for all of your collaboration and follow-up on the crypto-asset related activity. Much appreciated.

Hi XXXXX

1. Thank you for sending this. To clarify, the retail working group was not involved, sorry for the confusion. To reflect collaboration with the WO, it would be RMS PPD and RMAS, as well as DCP. Thank you for the clarification, I will reflect the change in the A-Page Comment.

2. In terms of XXXXX, I'm uncertain what 'cryptocurrency activity' would mean for the proposed A-page comment. Do you mean that the examination identified that XXXXX is engaged in crypto-asset activity, however, the funds held at the bank as of the exam represent capital raises, and that bank management provided information on the last day of the exam that indicated XXXXX customers will send funds to XXXXX account at the bank, so that XXXXX can purchase bitcoin on behalf of their users? If that is the case, did the bank provide copies of the end user agreement/disclosure? I think cryptocurrency activity may be expected in the future. Currently most of XXXXX money at XXXXX (see table below) is in CDs from capital raises. Our understanding was/is that XXXXX (cryptocurrency) has not actually started yet. Yesterday, I followed up with the BSA Officer and this is his email response: "Based on our most recent conversations with XXXXX, XXXXX

3. XXXXX

Thanks,

Hello, The open section of the exam will note that XXXXX accounts closed on or before XXXXX. I have the following A-page comment to provide continuity to future visits/exams:

Crypto Customers

Given that XXXXX serves as a custodian of crypto customers, the FDIC’s Retail Emerging Technology Working Group requested that certain documents be uploaded to XXXXX Chief, Emerging Technology Section Sumaya Muraywid is the Point of Contact.

The latest information for XXXXX was uploaded to the aforementioned XXXXX. The deposit accounts reflects capital raised, but at this time, there does not appear to be cryptocurrency activity - yet. However, this relationship should be reviewed at the next visitation or examination.

title: Bank's Crypto Partnership Withdrawal
Date: 2022-09-20
Summary: This document is a response from the FDIC's New York Regional Office to a bank's notification about withdrawing from a partnership with a company that would have provided customers the ability to purchase and sell Bitcoin. The bank cited crypto asset market volatility and evolving regulatory frameworks as reasons for withdrawal but indicated the partnership might be revisited. The FDIC acknowledges the notification and references FIL-16-2022, which requires FDIC-supervised institutions to notify the appropriate Regional Director about crypto-related activities. The FDIC requests that the bank notify the office prior to resuming the partnership or engaging in any other crypto asset-related services in the future, and provides instructions for submitting such notifications.

Subject: Response to Notification Regarding Crypto-Related Activities  

Dear Members of the Board:  

We are in receipt of your letter dated May 20, 2022, notifying us of your intent to withdraw from your partnership with XXXXX. The partnership would have provided your customers the ability to effect online purchases and sales of Bitcoin. Your letter stated that executive management and the Board determined that, due to current crypto asset market volatility and the evolving regulatory framework, offering these services to your customers through XXXXX was not conducive to the success of the program. However, Bank management has indicated that the XXXXX partnership may be revisited in the future.  

Financial Institution Letter FIL-16-2022, Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities, requests that all FDIC-supervised institutions that intend to engage in any activities involving or related to crypto-assets (also referred to as “digital assets”) notify the appropriate FDIC Regional Director. Accordingly, we request the Bank notify this office prior to resuming the XXXXX relationship or engaging in any other crypto asset-related service in the future.  

Written correspondence should be addressed to my attention at the New York Regional Office and sent as a PDF document through the FDIC’s Secure Email portal (securemail.fdic.gov) using the following e-mail address: XXXXX@FDIC.gov. Information about how to use secure email and FAQs about the service can be found at https://www.fdic.gov/secureemail/.  

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). If you have any questions, please contact Case Manager XXXXX at XXXXX.  

Sincerely,  
Frank R. Hughes  
Regional Director

title: Bank Ends Crypto Partnership
Date: 2024-03-05
Summary: This letter from the FDIC to a bank's Board of Directors accompanies a Report of Examination and discusses the bank's previous crypto-related activities. The letter notes that the bank had offered a cryptoasset service through a third party that allowed customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin. The FDIC had previously requested the bank not expand this service pending review and provided supervisory feedback about weaknesses. The bank subsequently notified regulators that it had decided to end the partnership with the third-party provider, sold customers' Bitcoin holdings, and closed the accounts. The FDIC acknowledges this change in status, considers the Matter Requiring Board Attention (MRBA) closed, and supersedes its previous letter regarding crypto activities. The FDIC requests notification if the bank's status regarding crypto-related activities changes in the future. (AI-generated)

Board of Directors

Subject: November 27, 2023, Report of Examination (Report)  

Dear Board Members:  

We have enclosed the subject Report prepared jointly by the XXXXX and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Report includes the findings of the concurrent Information Technology, Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism, and Trust examinations. Each Director should thoroughly review the Report and acknowledge this review by signing the Signature of Directors page included at the end of the Report. Please keep the signature page with the Report and record the Board’s review in the minutes.  

The overall condition of the institution remains XXXXX.  

The Bank previously offered a cryptoasset service through the third-party XXXXX that would allow deposit customers to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin. On April 5, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board stating plans to perform a detailed review of the activity at the April 25, 2022 examination and requesting that the Bank not expand the service until we completed that review. The FDIC and XXXXX provided supervisory feedback to the Bank in the April 25, 2022 Report of Examination and requested that the Board ensure that the weaknesses outlined are fully addressed. The Bank provided a response on October 31, 2022, and the FDIC and XXXXX provided further supervisory feedback to the Bank on February 15, 2023. On May 30, 2023, the Bank notified the FDIC and XXXXX that management and the Board voted to end the partnership with XXXXX. Customers with Bitcoin holdings were notified in July 2023 that the service would be stopped, holdings would be sold on October 17, 2023, and accounts subsequently closed. The Bank no longer maintains a relationship with XXXXX. The MRBA is considered closed. The FDIC acknowledges the Bank’s updated status related to this activity, and the April 5, 2022 FDIC letter to the Board is superseded as a result of the May 30, 2023 and subsequent communication to the FDIC. The FDIC requests that the Bank notify this office if the status of this activity, or other crypto-related activity, changes in the future.

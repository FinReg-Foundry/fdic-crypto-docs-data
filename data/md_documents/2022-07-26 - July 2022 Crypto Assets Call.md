Sorry, I looked at the retention letter before sending and I thought the date was 7/22/22. XXXXX actually sent the request to XXXXX on 7/21 through e-mail. XXXXX e-mailed back the letter on July 26, 2022. I have attached the e-mail stream as support.

Kindest Regards,  
XXXXX

I just took a quick look at the retention letter you sent me yesterday, 7/26/2022. The date on the form is 7/27/2022 (today). Can you just send me a reply with the actual date you received the authorization from your client? We will place that notation in our files with the original copy you sent us.

XXXXX

Good morning! I have attached a holders report for each of the accounts that hold the Crypto-related assets. This report will show the cost and market and last activity date for the security. I have also attached the retention letters for 

XXXXX

 you may already have). We do not have a retention letter in the file for 

XXXXX

. His last retention letter was November 2021 and the next would be November 2022. I have attached the 2021 letter so you can see that we actually do send one to him. I have attached the correspondence (3 e-mails) in the file related to the trade placed for 

XXXXX

 it shows his direction for the trade. In the meantime, I have requested that a current retention letter be sent to 

XXXXX

 to cover the Crypto-related asset, as you suggested would be best to have a current one.

It was really good meeting and speaking with you yesterday.

Please don't hesitate to contact me, should you need anything else.

Regards,

XXXXX

Good afternoon CEO XXXXX

My name is XXXXX and I am with the FDIC. I am assisting FDIC Case Manager XXXXX with her various duties. I am reaching out to follow up on the topic of crypto related products and services. Previous examinations and correspondence indicate that there was some interest and possible intent (but no immediate plans) to implement. Are there any changes in the bank’s strategy as it relates to crypto products/services? If so, could you please provide some narrative around the decision, as well as the plan? Regardless, as a reminder, please contact the Atlanta Regional Office before engaging in this activity, per the guidance in FIL 16-2022.

Thank you,

XXXXX

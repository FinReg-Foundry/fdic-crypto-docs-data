title: Bank Cancels Bitcoin Service Plan
Date: 2023-04-26
Summary: This letter from the FDIC's Dallas Regional Office acknowledges a bank's notification of intent to offer Bitcoin services through a third-party arrangement with an unnamed provider. The notification was provided pursuant to FIL-16-2022, "Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities." Following the notification, the FDIC requested information to assess safety and soundness implications and asked the bank to refrain from providing the service until review completion. The FDIC sent follow-up questions and planned a Visitation to review the proposed activities. However, the bank subsequently informed the FDIC that its Board decided to cancel the arrangement and cease pursuing crypto-related activities. The FDIC acknowledges this decision, cancels the planned Visitation, and notes that its previous letter has been superseded, while requesting notification if the status of these or other crypto-related activities changes.

Subject: Response to Notification of Engagement in Crypto-Related Activities  

Dear Members of the Board:  

We acknowledge the notification provided by Senior Vice President (SVP) XXXXX on August 17, 2022, of the bank’s intent to offer Bitcoin services to its customers through a third-party arrangement with XXXXX. The notification was provided pursuant to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), 16-2022, *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities*. On September 14, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting information necessary for us to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of the proposed activities. In the letter, we requested that the bank refrain from providing the service to its customers until we completed our review. On December 12, 2022, we sent management follow-up questions and requested additional information to assist in the review. On February 27, 2023, we notified the bank of our intent to perform a Visitation at the bank starting on April 10, 2023, to continue the review of the proposed crypto-related activities and provide supervisory feedback to the bank.  

In an email dated March 8, 2023, SVP XXXXX stated that the Board decided to cancel the arrangement with XXXXX and cease pursuing crypto-related activities at this time. We acknowledge the Board’s decision and the bank’s updated status related to this activity. As a result of the bank’s March 8, 2023 communication to the FDIC, we decided to cancel the April 10, 2023 Visitation and the September 14, 2022 FDIC letter to the Board has been superseded. We request that the bank notify us if the status of these activities, or any other proposed crypto-related activity, changes.  

This letter is confidential and may not be disclosed or made public in any manner under part 309 of the FDIC Rules and Regulations (12 CFR part 309). If you have questions relating to safety and soundness, please contact Case Manager XXXXX or by email at XXXXX. If you have questions relating to CRA or consumer compliance, please contact Review Examiner XXXXX.

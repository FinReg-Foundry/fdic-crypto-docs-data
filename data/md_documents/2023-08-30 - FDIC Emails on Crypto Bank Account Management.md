title: FDIC Emails on Crypto Bank Account Management
Date: 2023-08-30
Summary: This document contains email correspondence between a bank and the FDIC regarding the bank's relationship with a crypto-related entity. The emails document the bank's decision-making process about opening accounts for this entity, including notification to the FDIC that the bank had closed existing accounts and transferred funds to another institution. The correspondence shows that after conducting enhanced due diligence, the bank ultimately decided not to open new accounts for the crypto entity unless significant structural changes occurred at the company. The emails also reference that the entity had become a "crypto only platform," which the bank noted as a significant change affecting the risk profile of the potential relationship. (AI-generated)

Hi All –

I wanted to circle back on this and close the loop.

We XXXXX through an additional 30+ days of additional enhanced due diligence and have concluded that we will not be opening the accounts (unless significant future structural changes occurred at their company). We are in the process of notifying XXXXX of our decision.

Hi All – one additional factor that I wanted to share is the following, perhaps you are already aware of this:

See image below XXXXX became a crypto only platform ending their XXXXX from their platform. This is a significant change and does impact some of the risk of the situation and further demonstrates that these funds will be corporate only funds.

Perissa,

We received confirmation from XXXXX this morning that the wire had been posted to the instructed beneficiary account at XXXXX. There were no messages received today from XXXXX indicating it was being returned. Given that the wire was received by XXXXX yesterday, posted to the beneficiary account, with no return sent by close of the XXXXX today...we deem the wire to have been accepted.

Thanks,

XXXXX

Hi Perissa

XXXXX had it overnight, then returned it to us today.

We worked with XXXXX and they asked us to wire it to XXXXX. So it was back with us for about an hour or two before going to XXXXX.

XXXXX our COO if more information is needed.

Thanks

XXXXX

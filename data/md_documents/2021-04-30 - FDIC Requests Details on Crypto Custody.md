title: FDIC Requests Details on Crypto Custody
Date: 2021-04-30
Summary: This document is a response from the FDIC's Atlanta Regional Office to a bank's request for non-objection or approval to provide cryptocurrency custody services. The FDIC states it cannot provide feedback without additional information, specifically requesting details about the bank's expertise and risk management framework for overseeing cryptocurrency custody activities. The FDIC recommends the bank obtain a declaratory statement from state authorities regarding the permissibility of the proposed services and whether they constitute fiduciary activities under state law. The letter also notes that the bank's additional contemplated services (cash custody, lending against cryptocurrency, and settlement services) lack sufficient detail for review, and suggests addressing these after completing review of the custody services.

Subject: Letter Dated February 12, 2021  

Dear XXXXX,  

Your letter requests FDIC non-objection or approval for XXXXX to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency, and other related services.  

The FDIC is unable to provide feedback on the proposed cryptocurrency custody services without additional information.  

First, concerning the proposed cryptocurrency custody services, the FDIC needs to determine whether the bank has the appropriate expertise and risk management framework to appropriately manage and oversee the activity. Thus, we recommend that the bank submit detailed information regarding its existing or proposed oversight framework. The FDIC also needs to determine whether this activity is being conducted in a fiduciary capacity under state law. The XXXXX, in its February 16, 2021 letter, offered the Bank the opportunity to request a declaratory statement pursuant to XXXXX Statutes. Thus, we recommend that the Bank obtain such statement from the XXXXX concerning the permissibility of the proposed cryptocurrency custody services and whether such services will be considered fiduciary activities under state law.  

Second, the Bankâ€™s letter lists additional services contemplated by bank management, including cash custody, lending against cryptocurrency, and settlement services, but provides insufficient detail for our review. After we have completed our review of the proposed cryptocurrency custody services, we recommend that you provide a detailed explanation of the additional services that the Bank intends to provide.

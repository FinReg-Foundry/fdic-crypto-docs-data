On XXXXX, XXXXX announced its membership in the XXXXX XXXXX.

From this meeting, Federal regulators understand the XXXXX is currently drafting operating rules to govern transactions on the XXXXX blockchain network.  

Please be advised that the FDIC has a number of questions and concerns based on the information provided to date. We expect you to address those (in advance of implementation) to ensure the bank is operating in a safe and sound manner. [^1]

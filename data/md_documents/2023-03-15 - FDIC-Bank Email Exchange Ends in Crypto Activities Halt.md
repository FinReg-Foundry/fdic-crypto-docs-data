title: FDIC-Bank Email Exchange Ends in Crypto Activities Halt
Date: 2023-03-15
Summary: This email thread documents discussions between FDIC personnel regarding a bank's crypto-related activities. The bank initially expressed interest in pursuing crypto activities, which was discovered during a joint examination in April 2022. By March 2023, the bank's president informed the FDIC that they were no longer pursuing any crypto-related activities, citing recent events related to FTX as the reason for their decision. The correspondence shows the FDIC's internal monitoring process for banks interested in crypto activities, including requests for updates during interim contacts and discussions about whether the bank had submitted formal notifications about their crypto plans. The bank had previously indicated they were not close to implementing crypto activities and were waiting for regulatory guidance on permissibility. (AI-generated)

Hi XXXXX  

I just spoke to XXXXX President XXXXX said they are not pursuing any crypto related activities and said that based on the recent events related to FTX, they do not plan to pursue crypto related activities.  

I'll get the interim contact into RADD by the end of this week.  

Thanks!

Hi XXXXX

For the Interim Contact, could you please ask for an update on where their crypto plans stand? See the bottom of the email for the last weâ€™ve heard from the bank.

Also, XXXXX, please send me the Interim Contact, since I wonâ€™t see that come through my RADD inbox. Iâ€™ll then update Sumaya.

Thanks!!  
XXXXX

Hi Sumaya,

I messaged the SE and he said an Interim Contact was due 2/20/23, but they havenâ€™t gotten to it yet. The next joint exam is scheduled for 11/2023. When they do the Interim Contact, would you like the SE to ask where they are with crypto plans?

XXXXX what we were working on didnâ€™t really materialize. Is there a midpoint coming up with the bank any time soon?

Hi Sumaya,

Circling back with you about this. Have you given any more thought to next steps for XXXXX? Sorry I lost track in checking back with youâ€”somehow a couple weeks turned into a couple months! ðŸ˜Š

Thanks, XXXXX. I think itâ€™s fine to hold off on making that call for now. Weâ€™re thinking about this type of situation more broadly and next steps. I can circle back to you later. Feel free to ping me in a few weeks if you donâ€™t hear back from me.

Have a good holiday weekend!

Hi Sumaya,

No, they have not submitted a notification. We learned of this at the recent (4/2022) Joint exam. In talking to XXXXX, we have not discussed this with the bank since the examâ€™s Board meeting, where management stated that they were not anywhere close to implementing and asked us to let them know if/when we hear more about permissibility. So it seems theyâ€™re waiting to hear what we do. Would you like me to reach out to the bank and officially tell them to update us if their plans change, and then update this info? XXXXX, XXXXX

Thanks,

Hi XXXXX,

Thanks for the update. They have not submitted a notification, correct? Have they indicated they will notify us if their plans change?

For whoever takes XXXXX, please contact Sumaya Muraywid and let her know that we are not actively working this one since the bank is not going to do anything until guidance comes out.

title: Bank's Crypto-Asset Activities Delayed
Date: 2023-06-14
Summary: This document is a letter from the FDIC to a bank's Board of Directors regarding the bank's crypto-asset activities. The letter recounts that the bank notified the FDIC in May 2022 of its intent to offer crypto-asset buy, sell, and hold services to customers in response to FIL-16-2022, "Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities." The FDIC subsequently held discussions with bank executives, requested that the bank delay expansion of crypto-asset services, and sent a request list for additional information. Although the bank provided some responses, during a March 2023 phone discussion, the bank's President/CEO indicated that expansion of crypto-asset activity was no longer a top priority and that the remaining requested items would be submitted when management was ready to proceed. The FDIC requests that the bank keep them updated on plans concerning crypto-asset activity prior to pursuing them. (AI-generated)

Members of the Board:  

In a letter dated May 10, 2022, XXXXX (Bank) notified the FDIC of its intent to offer crypto-asset buy, sell, and hold services to customers, among other crypto-related activities. This notification was in response to Financial Institution Letter (FIL), FIL-16-2022, *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities*. Risk Management Supervision Case Manager XXXXX and Assistant Regional Director Michele Sharp and Depositor and Consumer Protection Acting Assistant Regional Director Karin Mance held a phone discussion with President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) XXXXX, Chief Credit Officer XXXXX, and Chief Financial Officer XXXXX on June 2, 2022, to discuss the Bank’s plans.  

On August 9, 2022, the FDIC sent a letter to the Board requesting that the Bank delay expansion of crypto-asset buy, sell, and hold services while the FDIC considered the proposed crypto-related activity. In a letter dated November 7, 2022, the FDIC sent the bank a crypto-asset activity request list and requested the information by January 6, 2023. Bank provided the response to the request items on the date requested. Additional items were provided on January 24, 2023.  

Following the FDIC’s review of the provided items, Case Manager XXXXX and Review Examiner XXXXX discussed the additional request list items that remained outstanding with Bank representatives. During this March 13, 2023, phone discussion, President/CEO XXXXX stated that the expansion of crypto-asset activity is no longer a top priority, and the requested items would be gathered and submitted when management is ready to move forward. No clear timeline has been established.  

Please keep the FDIC updated of the Bank’s plans concerning crypto-asset activity prior to pursuing the same. We will review then relevant information, which could include previously requested items.

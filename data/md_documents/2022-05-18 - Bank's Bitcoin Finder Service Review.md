title: Bank's Bitcoin Finder Service Review
Date: 2022-05-18
Summary: This memo documents a follow-up call between an FDIC Case Manager and a bank's President/CEO regarding the bank's Bitcoin finder service. The service had gone live and processed 80 transactions totaling $92,000, with 70 purchases and 10 sales. Transaction details included approximately 36 users (some being bank employees testing the service), with one customer responsible for about $50M in purchases. The bank reported no complaints, technology issues, or unusual customer activity. The FDIC representative informed the bank that it might be asked to suspend the service while issues are considered at a national level. The memo includes a spreadsheet of the Bitcoin transactions showing transaction IDs, buy/sell status, amounts, and order information. (AI-generated)

Case Manager  

Subject: Second Call Regarding Bitcoin Finder Service  

On April 14, 2022, the writer telephoned President/CEO XXXXX of the above bank to enquire about the status of the bankâ€™s plan to launch a Bitcoin finder service for customers. The following information was obtained.

- The service went live on XXXXX.
- There have been 80 transactions totaling $92,000. Seventy transactions were purchases and ten were sales. The sales totaled $1,800, so most transactions have been buy and hold situations. One person is responsible for approximately $50M of the purchases. Some of the transactions were bank employees who were testing the product if they wanted to. However, those were seemingly live transactions. A spreadsheet of transactions is attached.
- Based on the transaction list, approximately 36 people who have executed transactions, but some of those are bank employees.
- No complaints received from anyone.
- No technology issues have arisen.
- No unusual customer activity observed.
- No other banks in XXXXX group are involved as far as President XXXXX knows.

XXXXX was informed that the FDIC may ask the bank to suspend the service, while the various issues are being considered at a national level. XXXXX noted that customers can open XXXXX accounts and transfer funds from the banking system without restriction, so it is unclear why this service is problematic.

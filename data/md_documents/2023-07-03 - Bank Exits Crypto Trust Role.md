title: Bank Exits Crypto Trust Role
Date: 2023-07-03
Summary: This document contains correspondence regarding a bank's notification to the FDIC about ceasing its involvement with cryptocurrency. The bank informs the FDIC that it has received trustee resignation paperwork for a trust that held cryptocurrency, effectively ending the bank's connection to crypto-related activities. The correspondence indicates that the bank had been working toward a June 30th target date for closure of the trust, with assistance from an attorney to complete the resignation process. The FDIC had been monitoring this situation, with personnel from Chicago and DC involved in the oversight. The document also references a previous inquiry from the bank regarding pass-through and escrow accounts that was directed to FDIC insurance personnel. (AI-generated)

FYI on the XXXXX trust account that held cryptocurrency. Let me know if you need anything else; otherwise, I will presume this issue is resolved.

Thanks.

Good afternoon, XXXXX I hope you are doing well.

I am pleased to report that we finally received the Trustee resignation paperwork from the attorney who is working with us on the issue for the XXXXX Trust, with that paperwork completing the process for our resignation as Trustee for the Trust (the Trust that holds the cryptocurrency). I have attached for your records a copy of that documentation showing that we have effectively resigned, and therefore any potential involvement of our bank in cryptocurrency is now a non-issue.

XXXXX still needs to sign the document, however, as noted above our involvement with this XXXXX is now over.

Thank you sincerely XXXXX for your patience as we completed this procedural process.

Very best regards,  
XXXXX

First, please excuse my delayed response to you as I have been trying to get a status report from the attorney who is assisting on the XXXXX modification; XXXXX. I was finally able to connect with her this morning, and I am pleased to report that we are still on track to meet our June 30th target for closure of the Trust. Attorney XXXXX pledged to me that she would have the paperwork to us either this Friday or early next week to effect our resignation as Trustee of the XXXXX. Hopefully we will soon be out of any connection with crypto. YAY!

All the best,  
XXXXX

Good morning XXXXX

I hope all is well with you and your counterparts.

I just wanted to check in with you (on behalf of my Chicago and DC folks) to see if you still believe that the XXXXX account will be closed by June 30?

Also, did the insurance personnel at the FDIC adequately answer the question you and XXXXX had for me regarding pass-thru and escrow accounts?

Thanks as always XXXXX

XXXXX

Subject: Proposed Testing of Digital Asset Accounts

Dear Members of the Board:

On May 31, 2022, Interim Chief Financial Officer (CFO) XXXXX submitted a draft three-year business plan (Plan) pursuant to FDIC's Financial Institution Letter-16-2022, *Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities* (FIL-16-2022). FDIC staff held a brief discussion with President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) XXXXX, Interim CFO XXXXX, and the Digital Banking Division's Chief Operating Officer (COO) XXXXX on June 22, 2022. On July 28, 2022, the FDIC responded to the institution regarding the notification of engaging in crypto-related activities. The FDIC’s response acknowledged the bank’s Plan while requesting the opportunity to review additional information, when available, to assess the risk management framework surrounding these activities.

The FDIC’s July 28, 2022 letter included a request list of essential elements and requested that the bank not proceed with planned activities until the FDIC had completed its review and provided supervisory feedback. On August 5, 2022, President and CEO XXXXX submitted a new notification of XXXXX intent to originate test accounts and perform limited testing on two digital asset infrastructure providers, XXXXX (for XXXXX payments) and XXXXX (as sub-custodian for digital assets). On August 17, 2022, FDIC staff held a discussion with President and CEO XXXXX, Interim CFO XXXXX, and COO XXXXX, during which Bank management reaffirmed their commitment not to proceed with planned activities or account testing until the FDIC had completed its review.

The FDIC requests that the Bank provide the items requested in the Attachment to this letter, which seeks additional documentation and information regarding the proposed test accounts and the planned activities for lending and market making that were outlined in the Plan. Please provide the items requested in the Attachment, as well as the items requested in the July 28, 2022 letter by December 19, 2022. If the requested information has not yet been developed, include the status and timeline for developing each item in the response, as applicable. We will review documentation and information as it is received in order to assess the safety and soundness, consumer protection, and financial stability implications of the proposed activities.

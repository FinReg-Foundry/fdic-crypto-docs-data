   c. Please explain how/why the DLT/blockchain technology is used for these transactions.  
   d. Was the blockchain/DLT native token utilized to complete these transactions or does the bank anticipate using it to complete future transactions?  
   e. In order to participate in the XXXXX infrastructure, will the bank need to hold or utilize XXXXX native token? If so, what functions will the native token facilitate (e.g., gas fees)?  
   f. Provide a comprehensive overview of the DLT solution and related components, such as broker, referral, website, and any others.  
   g. Are smart contracts/chaincode utilized on the DLT to facilitate transactions? If so, explain what actions/transactions the smart contracts/chaincode govern. Provide the smart contract code and any assessments of that code.  

2. Please explain the node structure/consensus process of XXXXX.  

3. Does the bank serve as a node for XXXXX? If not, explain whether and how that limits the bank’s ability to view, transact, or otherwise interact on XXXXX.  

4. Does the bank serve any other role on the XXXXX blockchain?  

5. If responses to #2 and #3 are no, how does the bank initiate transactions (buy or sell) on the XXXXX infrastructure?  

6. The bank’s notification letter states that the bank utilizes a “parallel dual process.” The bank explained in an August 30, 2022 email that it maintains on-premises documentation on every XXXXX transaction identical to all other municipal transactions. Please explain in more detail what the parallel dual process entails, including, what documentation is on-premises, the digital process, and the dual processes for recordkeeping, clearing, and settling.

8. Provide a comprehensive overview of the DLT solution and related components, such as broker, referral, website, and any others.  

9. Outline which aspects of the XXXXX technology and or DLT have previously or are currently being used by the bank and when, versus aspects that are under development/consideration and are planned to be used in the future. During the recent FDIC examination, the bank’s Chief Information Officer XXXXX stated that XXXXX was in the proof of concept stage and was not live; however, the bank’s notification to the FDIC stated that the bank has purchased eight municipal bonds through XXXXX. Please clarify the discrepancy between the information provided during the examination and in the bank’s notification.

title: Bank's Crypto Activities and FBO Compliance
Date: 2023-04-18
Summary: This memorandum documents interactions between the FDIC and a bank regarding crypto-related activities, specifically the bank's establishment of a For Benefit Of (FBO) account for a crypto-related entity. The document outlines a timeline of events from April 2022 to April 2023, including the bank's notification to the FDIC about offering services to a crypto entity, the FDIC's determination that the activity falls under FIL-16-2022 requiring formal notification, and a subsequent meeting where bank management provided details about the FBO account. During the April 11, 2023 meeting, bank management disclosed that the account had been opened in April 2022 but operated with commingled funds rather than as a true FBO account, with plans to transition to a proper FBO structure. The bank also indicated interest in onboarding additional digital asset-related entities, and the FDIC noted that supervisory feedback would be forthcoming in a letter. (AI-generated)

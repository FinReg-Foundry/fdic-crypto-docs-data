Hi Frank — Letter attached for your review. Because we are using the template, we do not need to send this one to WO for review.

Thanks!  
Jessica

Jessica and Scott,

Attached are a draft letter and request list for XXXXX regarding their crypto facilitation activity via a planned partnership with XXXXX. We discussed this activity with Sumaya and XXXXX. They confirmed that the template request list should be used and does not need to be reviewed by Washington first if we do not deviate from the template language.

If you are okay with us sending this, please pass along to Frank for his signature.

Thanks,  
Ashley

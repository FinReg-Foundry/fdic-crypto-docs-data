Good Morning President XXXXX,

I hope you are having a great week. I am reaching out to my banks to determine if there have been any strategy changes related to crypto related products. As discussed at the last exam, your “bank has no immediate plans to implement any crypto related products or services”. I was following up to verify if there have been any changes in the bank’s strategy related to any crypto related products. If not, please confirm the previous statement. If the strategy has changed, please provide me with an update to your new plan. If you can respond by 9/13/23, that would be helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best Regards,

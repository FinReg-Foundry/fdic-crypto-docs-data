# FDIC Crypto Documents Public Repository

## About this Repository

This repository contains document data that comprises the [FDIC Crypto Documents](https://finreg-foundry.github.io/fdic-crypto-documents/) collection, created by the FDIC Crypto "Pause Letters" project. Specifically, it includes:
- The processed and coverted documents in markdown format
- The PDF versions of the documents reassembled from individual page images created from the original PDF
- The individual page images created from the original PDF

The data is intended to help the financial services, technology, and legal communities better understand the FDIC's approach to regulating crypto-related activities and to learn from the unusual trove of documents that lift the veil on the confidential supervisory process. Interested parties are welcome to use this data for research and analysis. The data is provided "as is" and without any warranty. Please see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information. The original files released by the FDIC can be found at the [FDIC FOIA Reading Room](https://www.fdic.gov/foia/foia-reading-room).

## About the FDIC Crypto "Pause Letters" Project

The FDIC Crypto "Pause Letters" project is a collaborative effort led by the advisory firm [FinReg Foundry](https://www.finregfoundry.com/). The FDIC Crypto Documents are a collection of documents released by the FDIC, including letters, memos, emails, and reports related to the supervision of banks that engaged in or sought to engage in crypto-related activities. The documents were released in a handful of large scanned PDF files, which are not searchable and have low quality and extensive redaction. The goal of this project is to provide a better way to explore and analyze these documents, taking advantage of recent technology developments. The data is provided in a more accessible format, including markdown files and additional AI-extracted and AI-generated metadata. The project also includes a portal with dashboards and views to help users navigate and understand the content.
